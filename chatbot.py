I'm here to help you check if you're eligible for compensation under EU Regulation 261/2004.

**Two ways to check your eligibility:**

**Option 1: Verify a specific flight** (Real-time data!)
- Just tell me: "Check flight KL1234" or "Verify flight BA456"
- I'll look up the actual flight data and determine eligibility
- Note: Works for current and upcoming flights

**Option 2: Describe your situation manually**
- Was your flight delayed, cancelled, or were you denied boarding?
- How long was the delay (in hours)?
- What was your route or distance?

**Examples:**
- "Check flight KL1234"
- "Verify flight BA456 on 2026-03-16"
- "My flight from Amsterdam to Barcelona was delayed 5 hours"
- "Flight was cancelled with 3 days notice, about 1200 km"
